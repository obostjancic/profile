          Computer science student and software developer currently focused on web development, but interested in pretty
          much everything that ends up compiled or interpreted. Currently, I am working as a web developer for Anyline
          GmbH, where I am mostly commited to development of a cloud infrastructure used to automate Machine learning
          and Computer vision processes. Colleagues know me as motivated, communicative and a creative developer who
          likes to help others, and who can be trusted to come up with a solution.

        can work well alone, but Iâ€™m at my best collaborating with others. Parallel to work I graduated with a Bachelor
