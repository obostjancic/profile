        <p className="from-left">I have been working professionally with Java for more than two years, and I am particularly experienced in development of stable and scalable REST API's using Spring framework. My primary role was mostly that of a backend developer, but because of my interest in all parts of software development process, I frequently took responsibility in other areas like: Frontend development, Database design, UI/UX design and deployment processes.</p>
        <p className="from-right">Apart from work I developed a web application with Python (Django framework) used to create, search and manage language corporas. It utilizes natural language processing to recognize and categorize words from input text. It is currently in production and contains 7.000.000 + words. </p>
        <p className="from-left">During my studies, I have taken part in various projects in different areas of computer science like: Computer graphics, Computer vision and Artificial intelligence. Most notably, I was a team leader on a student attendance system which was developed as an internal faculty project.</p>
        <p className="from-right">When it comes to my side projects, I generally choose technologies with which I havenâ€™t had a lot of experience to that point. I enjoy 'Learning-by-doing' and picking up a new framework or library is not a problem for me.</p>
