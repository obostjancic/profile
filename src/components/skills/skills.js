      I have been working professionally as a Web developer for more than three years, and I am particularly experienced
      in the development of stable and scalable REST API's. Even though my primary role was that of a backend developer,
      I frequently took responsibility in other areas like: Frontend development, Database design, UI/UX design and
      deployment processes.
