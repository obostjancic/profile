            Computer science student and software developer currently focused on web development, but interested in
            pretty much everything that ends up compiled or interpreted. Currently, I am working as a web developer for
            Anyline GmbH, where I am mostly commited to development of a cloud infrastructure used to automate Machine
            learning and Computer vision processes. Colleagues know me as motivated, communicative and a creative
            developer who likes to help others, and who can be trusted to come up with a solution.

        can work well alone, but Iâ€™m at my best collaborating with others. Parallel to work I graduated with a Bachelor
        in Computer Science, and I am studying a Master Degree in Computer Science. Contact me, take a look at some of
